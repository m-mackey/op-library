# the Odin Project - Library

Small library application for tracking books and Read status. 

See it live [here](https://m-mackey.github.io/op-library/).

## Built With

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

I didn't spend much time with the CSS because I wanted to focus on the new things I was learning with Javascript. I know that I have the skills to make it look fancier, I just don't want to worry about it at this time. It seem like this project will be revisited at a later date, and I can improve the look of it then. 

## (Some of) What I Learned

- Object constructors
- Prototype functions 
- Modifying objects
